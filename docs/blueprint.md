## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Orange (#FF8000) for a technological highlight. Chosen for its bold representation of the tech focus, avoiding cliched blues and greens. Use for buttons, active links, highlight icons, progress bars, or elements needing attention.
- Background color: Dark Grey (#262626). Apply a subtle tint of this color at low saturation, perhaps with a discreet gradient for section backgrounds, creating a Dark Mode atmosphere.
- Accent color: Cobalt Blue (#0047AB). Use for contrast elements, such as some subtitles, borders, or graphics.
- Font for headlines: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif, with a tech-inspired visual).
- Font for body text: 'Inter' (sans-serif, for high legibility).
- Use modern and minimalist icons for social media links and skills.
- Visual background: Dashboards and Dark Mode. Use architectural diagrams, code patterns, or network connections as subtle background graphic elements, with low opacity.
- Subtle and professional animations (e.g., fade-ins, scroll reveals) that enhance content without being distracting.
